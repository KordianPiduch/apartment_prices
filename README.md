# Apartment Prices is Gdynia Estimator: Project Overview

Main goal for this project is to get and prepare data from scratch. Find and build best possible prediction model. 


**Python version:** 3.10.2.  
**Packages:** selenium, pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.  
**Data resource:** https://otodom.pl



# TO DO
[ done ] Create script to scrap information about apartment prices from otodom.pl using python and selenium.  
[] data cleaning.   
[] data engineering.  
[] eda.  
[] prepare pipelines for regression models.  
[] try few models (multilinear regressor with and without regularization, Random Forest Regressor).   
[] select and fine-tune most promising models to reach the best model (using GridSearchCV).   
[] make this documentation much better.   
  
[] ? build api for best model -> flash ?
